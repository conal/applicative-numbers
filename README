project-foo [1] is a template for a package, to make it easy to copy &
modify.  It uses cabal-make [2] for convenience.  It's even equipped with
a darcs repo.  Copy the directory ("cp -rp"), "darcs mv" and edit the
.cabal file, edit README and wikipage.tw, and "rm _darcs/prefs/*repo*".
Then add new content with "make check-add" and "make add-new".  "darcs
record" the changes.  When ready, do a "darcs put" or "make repo".
