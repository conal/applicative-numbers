foo [1] is a template for a package, to make it easy to copy & modify.  It
uses cabal-make [2] for convenience.  It's even equipped with a darcs
repo.  Copy the directory ("cp -rp"), "darcs mv" the .cabal file, edit
README and wikipage.tw.  Then "darcs update" the changes and add new
content with "make check-add" and "make add-new".  When ready, do a "darcs
put" or "make repo".

Please share any comments & suggestions on the discussion (talk) page at
[1].

You can configure, build, and install all in the usual way with Cabal
commands.

  runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
  runhaskell Setup.lhs build
  runhaskell Setup.lhs install
